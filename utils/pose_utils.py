    Calculate the average pose, which is then used to center all poses
    using @center_poses. Its computation is as follows:
    1. Compute the center: the average of pose centers.
    2. Compute the z axis: the normalized average z axis.
    3. Compute axis y': the average y axis.
    4. Compute x' = y' cross product z, then normalize it as the x axis.
    5. Compute the y axis: z cross product x.

    Note that at step 3, we cannot directly use y' as y axis since it's
    not necessarily orthogonal to z axis. We need to pass from x to y.
